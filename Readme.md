# Cdiscount Search Scrapper

Always wanted to search specific products at a maximum price ? Alright then you are in the right price cause it will scrap the website to report you the list of the product you are looking for

# Install

```bash
npm install
```

# Setting up

```bash
copy config.sample.js config.js
```

Then put your email settings inside

# Run

```bash
node app.js
```

# Later ?

Maybe I will put a dynamic list of search from command line or even in a settings file and then load the url from them.
It would be nice to set a maximum or even a min price for each url search
